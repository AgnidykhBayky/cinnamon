# Cinnamon Boilerplate

#### Simple, scalable boilerplate to help kick start your projects.

## Features

* Scaleable directory structure with clear, granular & intuitive naming conventions.
* Ships with a handful goodies including an HTML5 template, jQuery, underscore, signals & cssmixins to help make your site awesome!
* Integrates seamlessly with [CodeKit][codekit] for all your concatenation and minification needs.

## Rationalle & Suggested Usage

* A *graphics* folder and an *images* folder, what's that all about? In a nutshell, if it's referenced as a background-image or is an embedded logo, it goes in the graphics folder. If it's referenced as the src of an img element, it goes in the images folder.
* Keep it consistent and adopt the conventions laid out before you. If you are embedding plugins such as SWFs, put them in a embeds folder. If you are referencing videos, put them in a videos folder. Maintain the verbose naming conventions and the world will be at peace with you.
